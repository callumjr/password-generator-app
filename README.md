# Password-Generator
A program that generates a strong password for you allowing you to input anything you would like to appear in the password.

How to use: 
1. You can have the program generate a random secure password for you by entering the ammount of characters you would like and press the generate button.

2. Otherwise you can use the input fields to specify any words, numbers and special characters you would like in the password. (If you also input the number of
characters you would like the program will add extra characters to make up the extra characters. If your input is over the number of characters you have set
it will still make a password but give you an error message about the number of characters.)

3. Lastly press the generate button and the program will generate your password for you. If you dont like it you can re-press the generate button and you 
will have a different password generated each time.
